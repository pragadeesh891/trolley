# Network Access Instructions

Your Smart Shopping Trolley application is now accessible over the network!

## For Local Access (on this machine):
- Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:8000
- Or: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## For Remote Access (for your friends):
- Your IP Address: 192.168.128.56
- Port: 8000
- Full URL for friends: http://192.168.128.56:8000

## Instructions for Friends:
1. Make sure you're all connected to the same Wi-Fi network
2. Open a web browser on their device
3. Enter the URL: http://192.168.128.56:8000
4. They should see the Smart Shopping Trolley interface

## Important Notes:
- The application will only be accessible while this server is running
- If your computer goes to sleep or the server is stopped, friends will lose access
- Make sure your firewall allows connections on port 8000
- Some networks may block device-to-device communication

## Troubleshooting:
- If friends can't connect, check if Windows Firewall is blocking the connection
- Ensure your computer doesn't go to sleep (change power settings if needed)
- Verify that all devices are on the same network
