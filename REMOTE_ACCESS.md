# Remote Access Instructions

Since you and your friend are on different networks, here are several ways to share your Smart Shopping Trolley application:

## Option 1: Using Serveo (Recommended - No Signup Required)

1. Keep your current server running (it should be running on port 8000)
2. Open a new terminal/command prompt
3. Run the following command:
   ```
   ssh -R 80:localhost:8000 serveo.net
   ```
   
4. The first time you run this, you'll see a security message. Type "yes" and press Enter
5. You'll get a URL like: https://yourname.serveo.net
6. Share this URL with your friend

## Option 2: Using ngrok (Requires Signup)

1. Sign up at: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
2. Get your authtoken from: https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
3. Install ngrok: `pip install pyngrok`
4. Set your authtoken: `ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
5. Run: `ngrok http 8000`
6. You'll get a public URL to share

## Option 3: Deploy to a Cloud Platform

For a more permanent solution, you can deploy your application to a cloud platform:

1. **Heroku** (Free tier available):
   - Sign up at heroku.com
   - Install Heroku CLI
   - Create a requirements.txt file
   - Deploy using git

2. **PythonAnywhere** (Free tier available):
   - Sign up at pythonanywhere.com
   - Upload your files
   - Set up the web app

3. **Railway** (Free tier available):
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Automatic deployment

## Current Status

Your application is currently running locally on:
- Local URL: http://localhost:8000
- Network URL: http://192.168.128.56:8000

To share with friends on different networks, use Option 1 (Serveo) for a quick solution, or Option 2 (ngrok) for a more stable connection.

## Important Notes

- Your application will only be accessible while your computer is on and the server is running
- Make sure your firewall allows connections on port 8000
- Some antivirus software may block incoming connections
